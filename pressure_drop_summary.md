## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Core Components:**

1. **FEM Pressure Drop Calculation** (`simple_fem_solver.py`)
   ```python
   def compute_pressure_drop(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float]:
       # Find nodes before and after cylinder
       # Calculate average pressure before and after
       # Return pressure_before, pressure_after, pressure_drop
   ```

2. **LBM Pressure Drop Calculation** (`cylinder_flow_lbm.py`)
   ```python
   def compute_pressure_drop(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float]:
       # Get pressure field from LBM
       # Find grid points before and after cylinder
       # Calculate average pressure before and after
       # Return pressure_before, pressure_after, pressure_drop
   ```

3. **Comparison Framework** (`compare_methods.py`)
   - Integrated into main comparison script
   - Automatic pressure drop analysis for each Reynolds number
   - Comprehensive plotting with 4-panel analysis

4. **Standalone Analysis** (`plot_pressure_drop.py`)
   - Independent script for existing results
   - Enhanced plotting with error bars and statistics
   - Detailed physical interpretation
